IPND Stage 2 Final Project

For this project, you'll be building a Fill-in-the-Blanks quiz.
Your quiz will prompt a user with a paragraph containing several blanks.
The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the paragraph.
This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary!

Note: Your game will have to accept user input so, like the Mad Libs generator,
you won't be able to run it using Sublime's `Build` feature.
Instead you'll need to run the program in Terminal or IDLE.
Refer to Work Session 5 if you need a refresher on how to do this.

To help you get started, we've provided a sample paragraph that you can use when testing your code.
Your game should consist of 3 or more levels, so you should add your own paragraphs as well!

sample = '''A ___1___ is created with the def keyword. You specify the inputs a ___1___ takes by
adding ___2___ separated by commas between the parentheses. ___1___s by default return ___3___ if you
don't specify the value to return. ___2___ can be standard data types such as string, number, dictionary,
tuple, and ___4___ or can be more complicated such as objects and lamb da functions.'''

The answer for ___1___ is 'function'. Can you figure out the others?


Hint: It might help to think about how this project relates to the Mad Libs generator you built with Sean.
In the Mad Libs generator, you take a paragraph and replace all instances of NOUN and VERB.
How can you adapt that design to work with numbered blanks?

Set blank count to 0
For answer in answers:
blank string is equal to blanks list at index of blank count
print question
player guess equals input: print what is the answer to blank string
while player guess isn't euqal to answe
ask again
if we're here, the question was answered correctly. Yay..
replace the blank string in the question with the answer
add one to blank counter
if we're here for loop is done, all answers answered successfully.


level = get_level()
answer_list, question_string = select_quiz(level)
play_game(answer_list, question_string)

Select level of difficulty by typing into it. possible choics include easy, medium and hard.
